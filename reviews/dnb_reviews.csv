4,"August 21, 2019",4,"worst app ever? slower and affords less privacy and security than accessing banking through the browser on your phone or computer, only usergroup i can imagine benefitting from this is dnb's marketing division."

7,"August 21, 2019",1,complete trash. used to be ok. its hardly an app. more like their website that's been poorly converted to work as an app. one of the reasons that i changed to sbanken.
8,"August 20, 2019",3,"very unreliable, but when it works its pretty fast and easy to use."

13,"August 21, 2019",1,"rarely works, try to connect and just times out"
14,"August 22, 2019",5,this is the best app to know how much you have in your acount and alot more.
15,"April 15, 2019",3,edit: been a couple of weeks now since my last review and it seems quite a lot of the smaller features have been fixed. unfortunately though for me (i dont know if it applies to others) whenever i am required to log in with my bankid (either to log in or to make payments) it wont work. it gets stuck...full review
16,"May 19, 2019",2,"the few last updates are horrible. i have to log in even if i don't do any active operation. application logs me out randomly. loading times are much slower, navigation is awfully slow even on a powerful phone and fast connection. spending button is greyed out for no obvious reason. most of the butt...full review"
17,"May 23, 2019",1,"biometric login hardly ever works. the app is constantly down and not available through neither of the login options. feels like you're rolling the dice, which is not a suitable feeling for a banking app. have to login to view account, or use a widget which completely ruins your wallpaper, so not a ...full review"
18,"May 29, 2019",4,"been trying for a month to log in, no matter which log in option i choose it says there was an error. called dnb and they said to fix it just restart your phone. still didn't work. i will note that it did work fine when i first got it. i think the latest update has broken it. got it fixed now after ...full review"
19,"June 11, 2019",4,"a good overall app, simple and understandable ui, does what i expect from a mobile bank app. an improvement would be if i could use either my iris recognition or fingerprint while both are enabled. on my note 8, it only allows for iris if it's enabled, this doesn't work that well with sunglasses dur...full review"
20,"May 25, 2019",1,"what a tire fire! so now i can login, after trying the app again after a couple of monthts, but guess what? it cannot show my account! i'm trying to stay polite, but with all that money you can't build a proper app? seriously..."
21,"June 20, 2019",1,"it's slow to log in, like a pregnant sloth! several times it doesn't want to operate. i would expect something more useful, as an app which handles my bank accounts and my money."
22,"May 5, 2019",2,new version is worse than the old. why do i need to enter bank id every time i log in? can't this app work with samsung biometrics and can open it with your finger print?
23,"April 14, 2019",1,"stopped working for the second time this month, massive problems with signing in, i have to use web site to check my personal and bedrift accounts."
24,"June 20, 2019",1,what is the point of having this app if we have to enter onetime code for everything??? loading time is awful!!! can not login most of the time - try again try again try again!!!
25,"May 3, 2019",2,i cannot get bank id to work while any other app is open on my android phone. this also excludes mobilbank. if i'm using a pc then bank id works ok. very frustrating

27,"April 7, 2019",1,worst than previous application actually and instead of improving experience has frequent failures. also doesnt work at all in android q
28,"April 20, 2019",5,"so much better than it was! smooth, clear gui, solid set of basic features. room for development but five stars cos this is a massive step the right direction!"
29,"April 5, 2019",1,what the heck is this update?! i can not do what i supposed to do monthly paying bills and that....i am 65 and this does not do me good at all. snap and pay? i can hardly understand how to use my mobile camera. bring back tha old one please. i will change bank instead if this is what you are doing.
30,"August 21, 2019",5,i like the fact that it is easy to access my account.
31,"April 28, 2019",1,consistently receive error message when logging in. it never works
32,"June 22, 2019",2,"this version even worse than its previous one. this version is rabish, nothing to compare with sbanken app."

34,"May 14, 2019",1,"refuses to run on my rooted phone running android 9 with magisk and magisk hide enabled for the app. how am i supposed to trust these people with my money when their approach to security is so idiotic and backwards you'd think they have no technical experience at all, let alone knowledge about secur...full review"

38,"May 31, 2019",1,terribly confusing and not user friendly
39,"March 28, 2019",1,"the current version of the app has a very poor user experience, it is very unresponsive. it also has other ux issues.   it takes on average 3 seconds to navigate between areas/pages the app, yes even the ""back"" arrow is slow.
