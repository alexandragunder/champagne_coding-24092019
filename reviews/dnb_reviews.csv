4,"August 21, 2019",4,"worst app ever? slower and affords less privacy and security than accessing banking through the browser on your phone or computer, only usergroup i can imagine benefitting from this is dnb's marketing division."

6,"September 18, 2019",2,login doesnt work...no message either. shud be able view balance and transactions like the old app... :(
7,"August 21, 2019",1,complete trash. used to be ok. its hardly an app. more like their website that's been poorly converted to work as an app. one of the reasons that i changed to sbanken.
8,"August 20, 2019",3,"very unreliable, but when it works its pretty fast and easy to use."
9,"August 27, 2019",1,almost never works. often try to log in but get error 1012 with bank id
10,"September 7, 2019",2,jesus christ why is there no option to change languages? i've been stuck with this app in english forever

13,"August 21, 2019",1,"rarely works, try to connect and just times out"
14,"August 22, 2019",5,this is the best app to know how much you have in your acount and alot more.
15,"April 15, 2019",3,edit: been a couple of weeks now since my last review and it seems quite a lot of the smaller features have been fixed. unfortunately though for me (i dont know if it applies to others) whenever i am required to log in with my bankid (either to log in or to make payments) it wont work. it gets stuck...full review
16,"May 19, 2019",2,"the few last updates are horrible. i have to log in even if i don't do any active operation. application logs me out randomly. loading times are much slower, navigation is awfully slow even on a powerful phone and fast connection. spending button is greyed out for no obvious reason. most of the butt...full review"
17,"May 23, 2019",1,"biometric login hardly ever works. the app is constantly down and not available through neither of the login options. feels like you're rolling the dice, which is not a suitable feeling for a banking app. have to login to view account, or use a widget which completely ruins your wallpaper, so not a ...full review"

19,"June 11, 2019",4,"a good overall app, simple and understandable ui, does what i expect from a mobile bank app. an improvement would be if i could use either my iris recognition or fingerprint while both are enabled. on my note 8, it only allows for iris if it's enabled, this doesn't work that well with sunglasses dur...full review"
20,"May 25, 2019",1,"what a tire fire! so now i can login, after trying the app again after a couple of monthts, but guess what? it cannot show my account! i'm trying to stay polite, but with all that money you can't build a proper app? seriously..."
21,"June 20, 2019",1,"it's slow to log in, like a pregnant sloth! several times it doesn't want to operate. i would expect something more useful, as an app which handles my bank accounts and my money."
22,"May 5, 2019",2,new version is worse than the old. why do i need to enter bank id every time i log in? can't this app work with samsung biometrics and can open it with your finger print?
23,"April 14, 2019",1,"stopped working for the second time this month, massive problems with signing in, i have to use web site to check my personal and bedrift accounts."
24,"June 20, 2019",1,what is the point of having this app if we have to enter onetime code for everything??? loading time is awful!!! can not login most of the time - try again try again try again!!!
25,"May 3, 2019",2,i cannot get bank id to work while any other app is open on my android phone. this also excludes mobilbank. if i'm using a pc then bank id works ok. very frustrating
26,"May 9, 2019",1,"i prefer the old version! need to log in every time, must bring the kodebrikke everywhere. what was point?"
27,"April 7, 2019",1,worst than previous application actually and instead of improving experience has frequent failures. also doesnt work at all in android q
28,"April 20, 2019",5,"so much better than it was! smooth, clear gui, solid set of basic features. room for development but five stars cos this is a massive step the right direction!"
29,"April 5, 2019",1,what the heck is this update?! i can not do what i supposed to do monthly paying bills and that....i am 65 and this does not do me good at all. snap and pay? i can hardly understand how to use my mobile camera. bring back tha old one please. i will change bank instead if this is what you are doing.

46,"March 30, 2019",1,"app asked me for uninstalling and installing of new version, but i am keep getting error 1010, it doesn't work with bankid, not with other 2 ways offered. so only thin that i can do is to uninstall it and use web version."
47,"April 2, 2019",1,new update for new version thumbs down.i have to log in with bank id everytime.earlier version one time log in and could see transactions on my account. i am using android. i did try uninstall and install. it's not working.

52,"February 25, 2019",5,"this is a change to my previous one star review. was about to send through a complaint as it had appeared the app had caused my phone to go into an infinite boot loop that even a factory reset would not sort out, but dnb checked with the developers and provided proof there was an issue with the late...full review"
53,"March 13, 2019",2,"i primarily used the old app to do a quick account balance check. having to log in virtually every time defeats the purpose of having an app in the first place, and i might as well log in through the browser. also, it seems a bit silly to enter the phone number of the phone from which i am using the...full review"

55,"January 25, 2019",1,"you have to log in every time you open the app, this eliminates all useful features it would have as its a 3 step auth process every single time you open the app.   at least the old app worked and gave you info without bothering you, this is just bad.  it wont even let me use fingerprint login.  who...full review"
56,"February 21, 2019",1,"the app has become too cumbersome in use, is it really necessary to go through in-logging simply to check a balance? and why not allow the app to remember my phone number rather than have me tell it every time?  in 80-90% of the attempts at logging in, i'm left waiting, twiddling my thumbs, for the ...full review"

61,"February 9, 2019",1,"prefer the old app in all its simplicity (log-on with pin only - unless security measures now dictate otherwise? no need to carry keygen device to log-in. regrettably telenor charge if using ""bank-id på mobil"".). my requirement is basically to swiftly check balances and eventually equally easily tra...full review"

63,"March 10, 2019",1,"this app is just an appified web page that require your pin for public available services. basically it is just a bunch of links. the devs were so lazy they didn't even bother to hide it. the old app was good, this one isn't. any one can make great plans but ""great plans"" are not a product."

65,"February 8, 2019",4,"i really wish it would have the option for you to see you balance without having to log in, as the previous version. otherwise, it's no different than accesing in browser. i'm sure many used it primarily for that purpose, like me. i personally wish i could revert to the old me."
66,"February 7, 2019",1,it is the worst app from bank i ever had.bankid everytime?with new update i do not see my company account and just nothing there. doesnt work and it honestly never worked as normal bank app. look at sparebank or tatra banka(my homecountry bank app).this is just usefull unfotunately.and today i do no...full review

76,"January 22, 2019",1,"useless now. it was ok before, but now you can not even check your balance without your onetime code. if i wanted to do my banking i would use my pc. i used the app to check recent activity and balance. now that is not possible. please change it back."
77,"February 9, 2019",1,"i am using the app for a month, and at first it worked with the biometric log in but it's been a while and now it wants me to log in with bankid everytime i want to use the app. it is just annoying! fix it!"
78,"March 11, 2019",2,statment view jumps all over the place . trying to view recent transactions and every time i scroll (seemingly in either direction) it jumps further back in time. i'm going to have to log on to web app. surely this is a bug that needs attention?
79,"January 26, 2019",1,bad. what happen dnb? i loved the old version it was hassle free. i could check my balance easily. now on the new version i need to enter the codes and password everytime i want to check my balance. it is so annoying.
80,"January 28, 2019",2,"the most useful feature of the previous app, which was checking the bank balances without logging in, is gone. if i want to log into my bank i can do that just as easily through a browser."

82,"January 16, 2019",2,"the new update or version, it's not good. with the old version, we don't need to log in to see the balance. now need to put password or to carry the code generator just to see the balance. i don't know who thinks this."
83,"February 3, 2019",1,"where is the old app? i want it back. this new app is an downgrade, not an upgrade. poor interface and not user-friendly. still cant check balance without logging in. often denied entry, buffering a long time. old app was perfect."
84,"March 30, 2019",1,can't connect!!!!!! can't get trough verification with bankid/id mobil. serio?? useless!!!!!!!!!!!!!
85,"February 15, 2019",1,"the app was ok at best before the last update and that's being nice. it's now just a link to the mobile bank to your browser. so be smart, uninstall this app and just use your browser to go to the mobile web version"
86,"February 10, 2019",1,old app was better. here you need too use bank id for everything. you cant even check out your bank acount balance without bank id. and biometrics dosent work either. even if they work it takes way to long time to load.

88,"January 22, 2019",1,terrible!!! i don't like that you can't see your balance without connecting to your internet bank. i also missing currency changing opption so easy reachable as it was before. bacis i wanna say give me back old version of dnb app.
89,"January 18, 2019",1,previous app was faster and easy. the design of new all is not attractive and user freindly. i love the old app. it was simple and uncomplicated. new design is not attractive.
90,"January 27, 2019",1,"the old app was bad compared to sbanken-app. instead of creating an app on par with best in business, dnb has created a new app which is useless and not at all user friendly. the new version is even worse the the old one."
91,"March 10, 2019",3,"unlike the old one, the new app requires to log in to check account balance and is slower. however, the widget with the account balance info is a big improvement."
92,"April 1, 2019",1,"this app pushes the dnb puls play store app onto my home screen, that shouldn't be allowed dnb, your app obviously is very suspicious."
93,"February 3, 2019",1,"the app worked fine when it first updated to the new version. unfortunately since the latest update finger print login never works, making this a pretty useless app. fix the login errors, please."
94,"January 22, 2019",1,after the latest update (mid january 2019) i can't access the bank via mobile phone since it detects that the phone is rooted (which is not).  phone model/ sys version one plus one  a0001/ android 5.1.1
95,"January 25, 2019",1,very slow. i am not happy that i updated to this. the idea behind is great but the app is very slow which is a waste of time thus 1 star.
96,"January 19, 2019",1,"five times loggin, five times error. no fingerprint is found. what is different between using app vs using browser? it takes significant time to just check account balance compare with old app."
97,"January 21, 2019",1,i'm getting error 1010. i can't log in to app 😞. older version was better... at least i could check my account balance.
98,"January 24, 2019",1,completely useless now. the only function it served is now gone. i feel bad for the developers who had to listen to some ignorant executives and put their names on this fiasco of an app.
99,"February 6, 2019",1,"far too many bugs, only works properly once in a blue moon. can barely check my balance now after several tries."
100,"March 12, 2019",3,"mobile banking don't work, the screen icon is gone, the interface sucks ....bad job...i want the previous version back where everythigs worked normally .....ok after almost 3 months and 2 installs it works now ....most of the times"
101,"February 1, 2019",1,dnb when you pubish an app do you check for bugs at all? previous version was bad but this one is horrible to that extent that is unusable at all. please at least return previous version and hire competent people to make at least decent app you cheap ba.... moving to another bank...
102,"January 22, 2019",1,too complicated both login and function. previous version was redirecting to the webpage but faster and simple to check account. would revert back to the old app if still available 🙁
103,"January 28, 2019",1,login - error - retry - login - error - retry - login - error - retry - login - error - retry - use vipps to check bank account. a 13 step process now (can be shortened by using vipps straight away ) miserable little app.
104,"May 4, 2019",1,it is very bad updating for the app i hope we can get better updates because sometimes the app doesn't work..
105,"January 21, 2019",1,what a stupid update! worst dnb app ever. previous version was way better and more efficient in all possible terms. i think it's time to move to sparebank1!
106,"January 14, 2019",4,good upgrade in years. possibly now in the game for one of the best apps in norway. loved the payments tab with nice overview and biometrics is smart.
107,"September 19, 2018",1,"- ui design & ux is really one of the worst i ever experienced on a banking app, this app needs and extreme redesign makeover. - zero security, anyone have your phone can enter to your account.."
108,"January 16, 2019",1,complete junk. you only get 1 star as there isn't an option for 0 stars. can't log in via any method since latest update. bunch of amateurs. time to change banking provider.
109,"January 14, 2019",2,i have to log in with bank id every time i load the app. no option for fingerprint loggin. my phone is a samsung s8+ so i do have a fingerprint scanner. very annoying
110,"February 12, 2019",1,"can make payments now which is nice but logging in hasn't worked in weeks, so basically can't use the app for anything anymore."
111,"February 1, 2019",1,cannot login. after successfully login to mobile bank it redirects to some kind of api page and stops there. nothing happens next.
112,"February 6, 2019",1,the new version(this one) is full of errors and never works. bring back the old version!
113,"February 19, 2019",1,"who had the idea to change the app? get that person and fire her. it was good as it was, now i have to log in everytime just to check my account. did anyone complain about the previous app? why change something thats good and for worse? before you did this mess do you even ask your costumers? dnb ju...full review"
114,"October 13, 2018",1,"probably the worst bank app i ever seen. poor ux and ui, icons that redirect to web pages, but the worst is the lack of security features - no pin or password to login..."
115,"February 13, 2019",2,every time i open the app it ask me for log in details! also the widget working only if signed in! not very convenient. is there anything i can do to remain logged in?
116,"January 29, 2019",1,"the former app was really nice and easy to use, why is now necessary to login with bankid just to check the saldo and account movements?"
117,"January 21, 2019",1,i would like to see how much i have in my account without logging in. i liked the old app better.
118,"March 12, 2019",1,less functionality than the old app. constantly crashing and awfully slow at getting data from the database.. 😩
119,"January 17, 2019",1,"it was so good before, that i could check my account balance with one push on the app, now i need to sign in and sign in.."
120,"May 15, 2019",1,basically just a fancy shortcut to the web browser.
121,"January 25, 2019",1,terrible app design. need to keep entering bankid every time. slow to load data. old app far better.
122,"March 16, 2019",1,"new app has never worked, why launch something that doesn't work. with all that money you can't even make an app that allows me to check my accounts."
123,"January 19, 2019",1,"if something isn't broken don't try to fix it. the update has made this app useless, can't you go back to the previous version at least?"
124,"February 6, 2019",1,i can no longer login to the app or to the mobile bank on tye phone since this pain has been launched.
125,"February 2, 2019",2,hardly ever manages to log in after the last update that changed the layout.
126,"April 5, 2019",1,can't log in with android -- useless.
127,"May 5, 2019",1,i can't access my account (very epic!)
128,"March 15, 2019",1,"after software update (galaxy s8), biometric logging does not work."
129,"February 25, 2019",1,i could check my balance before without logging in. now i have login every time. i dont like this update

419,"January 27, 2019",4,etter mange oppdateringer så funker endelig appen igen. widgeten for saldovisning er ett stort plus. tips for dere som fortsatt sliter med inlogging er att prova en annan webbläsare för bankid verifiseringen. google chrome virket for meg medans microsoft edge ikke lastet den in riktig.
