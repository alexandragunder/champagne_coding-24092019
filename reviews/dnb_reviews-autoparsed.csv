37,"March 28, 2019",1,Sindri Jóelsson,"The current version of the app has a very poor user experience, it is very unresponsive. It also has other UX issues.   It takes on average 3 seconds to navigate between areas/pages the app, yes even the ""back"" arrow is slow. (3 seconds).  ""Me"" -> ""Home"" (3.5s)  ""Me"" -> ""Me/Accounts"" (3.5s)  In addition, when loading the ""Me/Accounts"" page of the app, it takes a another 3 seconds to be able to scroll down to see your other accounts. Is this a separate query because you've used paginated data or something?  I've noticed the ""material"" animation on the button always finishes before navigation happens, I hope the app is not waiting for animations to finish before issuing queries? I say this because it happens even for pages that do not have to load data, like ""Me"" -> ""Me/Insurance""  The back arrow does not have any activation animation, together with the unresponsiveness it's hard to know if you've managed to tap it or not.  The transaction list and transaction detail view: Most transaction comments are truncated, tapping on it to go into the detail view does not help because it is not visible.  That's all that I can fit in this review."

52,"March 13, 2019",2,Christopher Santana,"I primarily used the old app to do a quick account balance check. Having to log in virtually every time defeats the purpose of having an app in the first place, and I might as well log in through the browser. Also, it seems a bit silly to enter the phone number of the phone from which I am using the app every time I log in with mobile bankID."
53,"February 22, 2019",1,A Google user,"After the last major update the app became completely useless. It doesn't keep me logged in and I have to carry around my bank code all the time if I want to use the app. And it's extra uncomfortable when I travel plus to that mobile id is not an option in this case cause I have a different sim card. Used to be a nice way to check my ballance on the go, but not anymore. :("
54,"January 25, 2019",1,Tommy Kristiansen,"You have to log in every time you open the app, this eliminates all useful features it would have as its a 3 step auth process every single time you open the app.   At least the old app worked and gave you info without bothering you, this is just bad.  It wont even let me use fingerprint login.  Who designed this garbage, DNB you better ask for your money back and do a rollback to the previous version because this is not good enough.  Least functional bank app I have had the displeasure of using."
55,"February 21, 2019",1,Gordon,"The app has become too cumbersome in use, is it really necessary to go through in-logging simply to check a balance? And why not allow the app to remember my phone number rather than have me tell it every time?  In 80-90% of the attempts at logging in, i'm left waiting, twiddling my thumbs, for the app to load the main page...... despite having full 4G coverage or router access, i'm more often than not told there has been an error, and given some cryptic error code......... becoming very frustrating.  The new app may look better, but functionally and convenience wise, its in most regards a downgrade."
56,"April 28, 2019",4,Emielian S,It works very well now. Thanks DNB.
57,"January 25, 2019",2,Marin Malnar,"A big step back - you now can't see your balance/latest transactions without having to log in.

59,"February 9, 2019",1,Pål Arne JANNANG,"Prefer the old app in all its simplicity (log-on with PIN only - unless security measures now dictate otherwise? No need to carry KEYGEN device to log-in. Regrettably Telenor charge if using ""BANK-ID på mobil"".). My requirement is basically to swiftly check balances and eventually equally easily transfer between accounts. Payments one can often execute via VIPPS. Seemingly this app is still in it's BETA stage? Cannot open attachments (PDF ?) to view payments the app requests me to authorise."
60,"February 5, 2019",1,Alan Belardinelli,"Remember the old app, where you could see your bank acct info and not go into a login death-spiral every time you tried to open the app to check your balances? Yeah, good times... Time to go bank shopping, I guess, because this app feels like an electronic metaphor representing how much DnB values me as a customer."
61,"March 10, 2019",1,Gunnar Söderman,"This app is just an appified web page that require your pin for public available services. Basically it is just a bunch of links. The devs were so lazy they didn't even bother to hide it. The old app was good, this one isn't. Any one can make great plans but ""great plans"" are not a product."
62,"February 11, 2019",1,Erik Kvaløy,"Every time the app starts it jumps past the point where I use my fingerprint and goes into the main menu. But since I haven't logged in it shows an error. I then have to stop the app and open it again. First then do I get to use my fingerprint to log in. other than that, the app is overall quite slow."
63,"February 8, 2019",4,Diana Diana,"I really wish it would have the option for you to see you balance without having to log in, as the previous version. Otherwise, it's no different than accesing in browser. I'm sure many used it primarily for that purpose, like me. I personally wish I could revert to the old me."

Dette er en feil som har ligget i appen siden den ble ""forvandlet"" fra forrige versjon, der man var automatisk logget inn og kunne se kontoen med ett trykk. Tilgjengeligheten til den forrige versjonen er borte, og et mer ""sikkert"" alternativ har erstattet den. Dette alternativet fungerer sjeldent og man må ty til å logge inn med kodebrikke. Da kan man likegodt logge inn på nettleseren istedet for appen. En oppdatering er høyt nødvendig."

Hvordan i alle dager?!??! klarer dere, DnB, etter så mange år, å lansere en så fantastisk lite intuitiv, men heller direkte vanskelig å bruke app??? Opplevelsen jeg sitter igjen med nå etter å ha brukt den litt, er en enorm frustrasjon over veldig tidkrevende og hverken innovative eller intuitive løsninger på selv de enkleste av bank-oppgaver. Her bør dere ta en titt på konkurrentene deres (Sparebanken, hint hint)"

Selv om noe av funksjonaliteten sender deg til en nettside, så har du enkle funksjoner som å Betale/Overføre direkte i appen. Jeg håper de tar dette lengre og integrerer mer funksjonalitet. En detalj som er verdt å nevne (om utviklerne ser dette) er at den elegante animasjonen inn mot skjermbildet man kan gjøre en betaling/overføring er tregere enn hva den kan være. øk hastigheten på den. Får funsjonen til å virke sluggish. Ellers bra design."

Den tar deg over i en nettside, og da er det jo ikke mulig å forhåndsloade appen i tilfellet man ikke har nett.
