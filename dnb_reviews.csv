86,"January 24, 2019",Max Mann,1,Completely useless now. The only function it served is now gone. I feel bad for the developers who had to listen to some ignorant executives and put their names on this fiasco of an app.

111,"February 10, 2019",Adam Rajewski,1,Old app was better. Here you need too use bank id for everything. You cant even check out your bank acount balance without Bank id. And biometrics dosent work either. even if they work it takes way to long time to load.

805,"October 17, 2012",A Google user,1,Veldig treg og mobilen min crasha flere ganger pga appen! Det er bedre med netbanking i browsern :-(
806,"September 20, 2012",A Google user,4,"Samsung Note, Telenor -  Engelsk versjon. -  En enklere måte å komme seg helt ut av appen på (ikke bare utlogging av mob.banken, men stenge appen helt) -  Mulighet for overføring av kreditt fra MasterCard til annen konto (dette må jeg fremdeles gjøre i nettbanken)  Enkelte har påpekt at sending av s...Full Review"
807,"July 21, 2012",A Google user,3,"innlogging går tregt, får ofte web page not available selv med god dekning eller wifi. trykkfelt spesielt for liste av kontoer og valg på hovedmeny er for små/smale for oss med store hender så lett å trykke feil; savner mulighet for å zoome. funksjonalitet er helt grei"
808,"August 15, 2012",A Google user,1,Bortkastet tid og en generelt dårlig app never the less the smooth design.
809,"July 19, 2012",A Google user,1,Nærmest ubrukelig
810,"June 22, 2012",A Google user,1,The window with confirmation code never appears so it's impossible to login. Samsung google nexus / ice cream sandwich
811,"June 13, 2012",A Google user,5,Funger som den skal - mangler honeycomb-støtte
812,"June 8, 2012",A Google user,2,Ustabilt
813,"June 6, 2012",A Google user,1,"Fungerer ikke... Kom så langt som til inloggingsbilde, men når man trykker logg inn, virker det som om neste prosess bare går i loop og man må mare force close appen.  Utrolig at dette kan være en offisiell app fra et så stort firma som DNB."
814,"June 13, 2012",A Google user,1,"Stor (6,7mb) treg, innlog fungerer skjelden/aldri fra utland, og full av unyttig gags. Amatørmessig av DNB! Utlandske banker er lysår foran DNB!"
815,"June 6, 2012",A Google user,1,"Autentiseringen via BankID går ok, men blir ikke dirigert videre inn i banken. Appen blir jo rimelig ubrukelig da. Har Samsung Galaxy S"
816,"February 10, 2012",A Google user,1,Facebook link is more important for you than bank services for other countries and languages where DNB works. (Lithuania)
817,"May 13, 2012",A Google user,1,Funker dårlig.
818,"December 14, 2011",A Google user,1,Hadde forventet mer fra norges største bank. Fungerer ikke I android 4.0 og utvikleren er arrogant
819,"November 13, 2011",A Google user,1,Har fortsatt «mock locations» som sikkert har blitt brukt under utvikling - skal ikke brukes i en ferdig versjon. Og hvorfor change wifi state?
820,"November 24, 2011",A Google user,1,Ikke noe annet enn snarveier til SMS saldo og mobil-internettsider. Poengløst å bruke 6 mb lagringsplass på dette.
821,"February 3, 2012",A Google user,5,Skjønner ikke hva de før meg klager på. Den fungerer jo helt supert. Redder dagen :)
822,"January 30, 2012",A Google user,1,Forventet mer av Norges største bank!
823,"December 11, 2011",A Google user,1,Hopp over denne applikasjonen.

PER DESIGN."
827,"July 21, 2011",A Google user,2,"Mye småproblemer og logger ut ved bruk av Back button. Finnes flere klager fra 2010!!!! Denne blir ikke fulgt opp, og kundene lider for dette Fy DNB!"
828,"March 8, 2011",A Google user,2,Vanskelig å bruke fordi den ikke kan vises i landskapsformat. Ikke helt gjennomtenkt eller testet.
829,"September 5, 2011",A Google user,3,"Ser ikke helt forskjell på denne appen og vanlig mobilbank, bortsett at skjermen ser rar ut på sensation."
830,"December 12, 2011",A Google user,1,Alle reviews / kommentarer sier det meste...
831,"April 15, 2011",A Google user,5,Digger den.
832,"January 3, 2011",A Google user,1,Mangler mye funksjonalitet ift andre bank-app'er. Fortsetter dessuten å bruke gps i bakgrunnen etter jeg har gått ut. Desire HD
833,"December 23, 2010",A Google user,5,Fungerer fint på Desire HD. Perfekt å ha hvis du er på ferie uten tilgang til PC og må innom nettbanken for å betale en regning eller noe.
834,"February 8, 2011",A Google user,2,Bruker mye strøm også lenge etter jeg er ferdig med det.
835,"December 25, 2010",A Google user,5,Supert!
836,"December 22, 2010",A Google user,5,Funker flott på Desire :)
837,"September 6, 2017",Heneve Mae Magto,1,It doesn't work! Always shows error message. DNB should fix this. It takes so much effort just to check and login in mobile banking sites. Do something like how Sparebank makes their app. Easy access and no stress. This app irritates me.
838,"June 21, 2013",Thor Undseth,5,Happy with being able to contact the underworld with this app. The lobster function didnt work as expected though.  If they build in NFC support it would be 10/10.
839,"July 16, 2017",Albert Romero,1,Doesnt even work properly half the time. It's embarrasing.
840,"February 20, 2014",Morten Torstensen,1,Access my call log? Get outta here! Use the browser? I can open that myself! Uninstalled!
841,"April 3, 2019",Erlend Hammer,1,Appen åpner ikke engang. Antar det er av samme grunn som Spare appen ikke fungerer lenger. De som har root får ikke bruke DNB sine apps lenger. Kan være verdt å nevne noe om i beskrivelsen.
842,"February 4, 2019",Blue Gintaro,1,"Prøver å logge inn på nettbanken, men får bare error melding hele tiden. Se å få rettet opp i feilen, eller gå tilbake til den gamle versjonen!"

844,"March 13, 2019",Skelly,2,"nye oppdateringen er noe av det mest plundrete og unødvendige jeg noensinne har brukt.... må konstant logge med inn på nytt, og det bruker tid og flere forsøk, og i tillegg får jeg da beskjed om å avinstallere + installere på nytt? Herregud, for et rot."
845,"October 13, 2016",A Google user,2,Since then it has only gotten worse. I really hope they are working on a complete refresh.

847,"February 10, 2013",Francis Smits,1,When I try and install the Android app it says that it is incompatible. This hardware has been on the market for 6 months at least. It appears that DNB is not really up with the times!!!

850,"August 20, 2017",Phat Tuan Luong,1,Funker ikke å logge seg inn. Helt grusom design. DNB burde skamme seg stort over å publisere denne appen. De burde for lengst ha skrotet den og gjort en ny app der de betalte for kvalitet.

860,"April 19, 2019",Walter Wold,1,"Rotete meny, uoversiktlig, ustabil på innlogg. Om man først kommer inn i appen, velger man fort ""gammel visning"" og ender opp med å bruke masse tid kun for å gjøre enkle operasjoner, som før gikl unna i en fei."
